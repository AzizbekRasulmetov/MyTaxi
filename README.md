Installation

## How it Works
MyTaxi uses MapBox to display real-time taxi locations on a map. The app uses ForegroundService and FusedLocation to track the user's location and store it in a Room database in the background. The app also uses MVVM architecture and Dagger Hilt for dependency injection. DataStore is used to store small amounts of user data such as preferences, settings, and login credentials.
